//! dv's headless domain logic: repo locations, the `Backend` interface and its in-process
//! `LocalBackend`, review targets and their labels, the git runner, the diff pipeline, the
//! review event store, anchoring and relocation, and GitHub through `gh` (docs/PLAN.md §2,
//! §5–§9).
//!
//! gpui: **never**. This crate runs in the CLI, inside WSL distros as part of the backend, and in
//! fast headless tests; `script/check` fails when gpui appears in its dependency tree
//! (PLAN §4, §13.2).
