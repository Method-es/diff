//! Reviews as append-only event logs (docs/PLAN.md D5, §2, §7).
//!
//! - [`id`]: `r-`/`t-`/`c-`/`e-` ULID ids, strictly validated before any path is built.
//! - [`event`]: the event enum, one JSON line each, and the forgiving log reader.
//! - [`model`]: the folded state — target, status, rounds, viewed files, threads, PR link.
//! - [`fold`]: events → state, with the status and thread-state rules (PLAN §2.4, §2.5).
//! - [`store`]: the logs, their snapshot cache and refs, over a [`crate::Backend`].
//! - [`snapshot`]: a round's new side kept as a commit under `refs/dv/` (PLAN §2.3).
//! - [`anchor`]: anchors built from a selection of a side's lines (PLAN §2.5).
//! - [`relocate`]: relocation and placement — where a thread shows once its file moved on
//!   (PLAN §8).
//! - [`history`]: a thread's round history: its file followed since its round, and where its
//!   code went (PLAN §8).
//! - [`excerpt`]: the rows of the diff around a thread's lines now, as the CLI prints them
//!   (PLAN §10.3).
//! - [`identity`]: the reviewer's name (PLAN §2.5).
//! - [`home`]: the worktree a review's target resolves in, whichever worktree reads it
//!   (PLAN §2.2, §2.4).
//! - [`ops`]: checked changes — what the UI and the CLI call.
//!
//! Many writers (the GUI, the CLI, any number of agents, in Windows and inside WSL) append to
//! one log at once without a lock: each event is one line written in one append (PLAN D5), and
//! every reader folds the lines in file order, so no update is ever lost.
