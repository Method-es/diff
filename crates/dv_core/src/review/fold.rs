//! Folding a review's events into its state (docs/PLAN.md D5, §7), and the rules every event is
//! checked against on the way (PLAN §2.4, §2.5).
//!
//! The file order of the log is the total order. Writers append without a lock, each having
//! validated its event against the state it last read, so two of them can race (the reviewer
//! resolves a thread while an agent addresses it). The fold is the final word: it applies the
//! same rules in file order, and an event that doesn't apply to the state it lands on is skipped
//! with a [`LogWarning::Rejected`] instead of corrupting the state. The operation layer
//! (`review::ops`) checks a new event with this same code before appending it, so the two never
//! disagree about what is valid.
//!
//! An event that changes nothing (marking a viewed file viewed again, a status it already has)
//! applies silently as a no-op ([`Outcome::Unchanged`]).
//!
//! A `reply_added` or `thread_state` event may carry the thread's relocated anchor (PLAN §8),
//! checked like a `thread_added` anchor: the thread is attached there from then on and keeps
//! the anchor it was opened with as [`Thread::original_anchor`]. A `status` event's note and
//! author become [`Review::status_change`]; one with `if_status` applies only on that status,
//! and one with `if_round` only with that many closed rounds, a no-op otherwise (PLAN §2.4: a
//! status or a round that lands between a writer's read and its append wins).
//!
//! Each round records, derived rather than written, the status the review closed it from
//! ([`super::model::Round::closed_from`], PLAN §2.4): a round closed while the agent was
//! `in_progress` is one it may not have seen, which an agent's `dv review done` must name
//! before it hands the review back ([`Review::unseen_round`]).
