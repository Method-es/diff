//! Review events and their log format (docs/PLAN.md D5, §7).
//!
//! A review is `<git-common-dir>/dv/reviews/<id>.jsonl`: one JSON event per line, appended in a
//! single write, never rewritten. Each line is an object with the format version `v`, a unique
//! `eid`, the time `at` (ms since the Unix epoch) and the event's `kind` with its fields:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"v":1,"eid":"e-01j…","at":1759560000000,"kind":"reply_added","thread":"t-01j…","id":"c-01j…","body":"Done.","author":{"kind":"agent","name":"claude-code"}}
//! ```
//!
//! Reading a log ([`parse_log`]) never fails as a whole: a line that isn't a valid event (a
//! line torn by a crash, a hand edit) becomes a warning and is skipped, and so is an event from a
//! newer dv — a higher `v`, or a `kind` this build doesn't know — which is counted instead, so
//! old builds keep reading logs that newer ones append to (PLAN §7).
