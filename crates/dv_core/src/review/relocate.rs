//! Relocation and placement (docs/PLAN.md §8): where a thread shows once the file it is
//! anchored in has moved on.
//!
//! - [`relocate`] finds an anchor's text in its side's current full text: still at its
//!   recorded lines, moved (an exact match nearby, the only exact match in the file, or a fuzzy
//!   match), or outdated.
//! - [`place_thread`] decides the listed file a thread belongs to now ([`thread_file`]: its path,
//!   the file renamed from it, or what its round's history says the file is called now) and
//!   runs [`relocate`] on that file's side; a new-side thread relocation can't find is traced
//!   through its round's snapshot to where its code went (`super::history`).
//! - [`place_unlisted`] places a thread whose file left the list against that file's text at
//!   the review's new side: found there, it stands in a file the review doesn't change.
//! - [`relocated_anchor`] is the anchor the next event on a moved thread records (PLAN §8:
//!   relocation is display-only until then).
//!
//! The GUI and the CLI place threads only through these functions, so they never disagree
//! about where a thread is.
