//! The review store over a [`Backend`] (docs/PLAN.md D5, §7): one append-only log per review
//! under `<git-common-dir>/dv/reviews/`, a snapshot cache of each fold next to it, and each
//! review's round snapshots under `refs/dv/reviews/<id>/`.
//!
//! The store itself doesn't judge events: [`ReviewStore::append`] writes what it is given and
//! the fold sorts it out (PLAN §7). The checked way to change a review is `review::ops`.
