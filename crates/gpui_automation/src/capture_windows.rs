//! Win32 window capture.
//!
//! GPUI presents through DirectComposition, so a plain `BitBlt` of the
//! window DC sees nothing: `PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)` asks DWM for
//! the composed frame instead, which also works while the window is covered
//! by other windows. If that comes back empty (remote desktop, odd drivers),
//! fall back to copying the window's client rect from the screen.
//!
//! The composed frame includes a DWM system backdrop (Mica, measured equal to
//! the screen pixel for pixel, active or inactive) but not the blur-behind
//! accent gpui uses for `WindowBackgroundAppearance::Blurred` (Acrylic):
//! translucent areas over it come out composited over black.
//! [`CaptureSource::Screen`] copies the client rect from the desktop
//! instead, blur and all, after checking that the window is in front so the
//! copy can't show another window.
//!
//! The HWND comes from the gpui window's raw-window-handle, never from
//! "the first visible window of this process", so multi-window apps capture
//! the window that was asked for.
//!
//! Sizes are physical pixels. The capture thread switches itself to
//! per-monitor-v2 DPI awareness for the duration so client rects are never
//! DPI-virtualised, whatever the process manifest says; on the 150% dev
//! display a 1440x900 logical window captures as 2160x1350.
