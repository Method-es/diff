//! App-wide services (PLAN §11), each a gpui entity shared by every window, installed once as
//! the [`Services`] global by [`init`] before the first window opens. Views reach them through
//! [`ActiveServices::services`].
//!
//! - [`Settings`] (`settings`): the window material, the light/dark mode and the panel's width,
//!   saved in the data dir as they change.
//! - [`Locations`] (`locations`): the one backend per repository, opened off the UI thread,
//!   and the connections to the `dv backend --stdio` servers remote ones go through (PLAN §5).
//! - [`Reviews`] (`reviews`): the known repositories (`known_repos.json`) and, per repository,
//!   its reviews and uncommitted changes, as the switcher lists them.
//! - [`ReviewUi`] (`review_ui`): what the reviewer chose per review (`review_ui.json`: split or
//!   unified).
//! - [`LanguageServers`] (`language_servers`): the language servers of every worktree a review
//!   is open on (`crate::intel::servers`, PLAN §18.5), with `settings.json`'s `lsp`.
//! - [`Setup`] (`setup`): every environment's setup checks, the first-run marker and the
//!   status bar's out-of-date skill notice (PLAN §12).
//! - [`Updates`] (`updates`): dv's own update, downloaded and ready to restart into (PLAN D9),
//!   which the binary reports.
//!
//! An open review is a `crate::session::ReviewSession`, which the shell holds; it works through
//! the same `Locations` backend. The `System` seam (opening URLs, revealing files, the folder
//! picker, the clipboard) is the separate [`crate::system`] global, because automation swaps it
//! for a recorder.
