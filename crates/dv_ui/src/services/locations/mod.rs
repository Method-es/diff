//! Where repositories live and the backends that reach them (PLAN §11 `Locations`, §5).
//!
//! [`Locations::open`] turns a [`Location`] into the one `Arc<dyn Backend>` dv keeps for that
//! repository, opened off the UI thread (opening runs git, and may start a distro) and cached by
//! both the location asked for and the worktree root it resolved to, so the switcher, the
//! reviews list and an open review share a backend.
//!
//! - **A local path** opens a [`LocalBackend`] with the user's own git configuration, unless a
//!   [`Route`] is registered for it ([`Locations::register`]): an environment overlay (the
//!   automation host registers its seeded fixture repos', so scenarios never depend on the
//!   owner's git configuration, PLAN §14.2), and optionally a loopback [`Connection`], through
//!   which it opens as a `RemoteBackend` (the e2e scenarios' `"backend": "loopback"`).
//! - **A WSL location** opens through its distro's connection in the app's [`Connections`]
//!   (PLAN §5.2), a `RemoteBackend` whose server is that distro's `dv backend --stdio`,
//!   started as [`WslAccess`] says.
//!
//! **The connecting rule** (PLAN §5.2). An explicit open ([`Locations::open`]: the user opening
//! a repository or a review, `dv open`, Start or Retry in the switcher) is the connection's
//! explicit start (`Connection::retry`): it connects whatever the connection's state, booting
//! a stopped distro, starting a failed or stopped connection once more; one that meets a
//! reconnect waits for it and goes on once it is back (or fails as the connection did). A
//! listing
//! ([`Locations::reach`]: the switcher's rows) only ever starts a server automatically, which
//! the connection does only on a host that runs: it goes through a connection already made, or
//! makes one only for a distro that is running. What it finds instead is the row's: a distro
//! that isn't running ([`Reach::Stopped`], whatever its connection did before), a connection
//! reconnecting ([`Reach::Reconnecting`]) or one that failed ([`Reach::Failed`] with `retry`).
//!
//! **Staleness.** A cached local backend whose worktree root has since disappeared is dropped
//! and the location opened again, so a deleted repo reports "no such directory" instead of a
//! git spawn error; that check reads this machine's file system, so it applies to local
//! backends only. A cached remote backend is kept, its connection started as the open allows,
//! also when an open fails only because its connection is down; a repository gone inside the
//! distro surfaces as the next call's error.
//!
//! Every connection this service goes through is followed: a change of its state repaints
//! whoever observes the service (the status bar says "installing dv…" while a review opens),
//! and one that leaves it reconnecting, stopped or failed, or brings it back from there, is a
//! [`LocationsEvent::ConnectionChanged`] (the reviews service lists its rows again).
//!
//! Which connection a location goes through ([`Locations::key_for`]) is known without the
//! file system, which the UI thread asking never reads: a WSL location's distro, else what the
//! last open of it found (its cached backend's connection, or its route's).
//!
//! **A distro's spelling.** `wsl.exe` takes distro names without case, so `\\wsl$\ubuntu\…` and
//! `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\…` are one repository, reached through one connection
//! (`ConnectionKey` folds the name). That connection is named as WSL spells the distro
//! (`wsl.exe --list`): an explicit open of a distro dv hasn't seen lists WSL's distros first
//! (off the UI thread; the listing is cached for 2 s), and a listing's open names a connection
//! it makes from the list it reads anyway, so every location the connection hands back
//! (`RepoInfo::location`) is spelled WSL's way. [`Locations::canonical`] spells any location
//! so, from what dv has seen; where WSL can't be listed the name stays as given, and callers
//! compare locations with the distro folded (`Location::same_place`).
