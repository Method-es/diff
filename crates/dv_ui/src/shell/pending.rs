//! A pick that waits for its connection (PLAN §5.2, DESIGN §4.4): a review picked in the
//! switcher (or the source picker, or `open_review`) is never lost and never reported twice.
//!
//! `Reviews::open` already waits out a reconnect that a lost connection under the open starts
//! and runs the open once more. When the open still fails because of its connection — lost
//! under it again (`Failure::disconnected`), or the connection failed or found its distro
//! stopped — the shell keeps the pick, at most one, as the **pending pick** of that connection:
//! - when the open review goes through the same connection, the main area raises nothing: its
//!   status bar and backend-down banner already say what is wrong;
//! - otherwise the main area's banner says "couldn't open <repo>" (the connection's error and
//!   diagnostics in Details), whose Retry runs the pick again;
//! - when the connection comes back (`LocationsEvent::ConnectionChanged { up: true }`, or it is
//!   back already when the open fails), the pick runs again by itself, its banner going.
//!
//! A newer pick replaces it, and the Dismiss of its own banner drops it (another banner's
//! Dismiss leaves it waiting). Running again by itself, it keeps open menus and the keyboard
//! where they are, and it never replaces a review that holds unsaved text: while the "Finish
//! round" sheet is open or a composer holds a draft, it waits on, and runs once the sheet
//! closes or the draft is posted or cancelled (its connection still up: an idle-closed one is,
//! since the next call starts it; one that went down again keeps it waiting). Its banner's
//! Retry is the user's own pick and runs at once. A pick whose open kills its connection every
//! time runs again by itself at most [`AUTOMATIC_RUNS`] times; then it fails as any open does,
//! in the main area's banner. Any other failure of an open is that banner too.
