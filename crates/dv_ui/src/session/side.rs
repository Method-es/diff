//! Files at the review's sides, whole (PLAN §18.1 "The file view", §8): one file's text as the
//! review's new side (or, for a file it deletes, its old side) holds it
//! (`dv_core::diff::side_file`), read in the background for the file view and for the threads
//! on files the review doesn't list, and the paths the new side holds, for `Ctrl P`.
//!
//! **Reads.** A file is read when the file view shows it (highlighted then too, `crate::syntax`)
//! or when a live thread's file left the review's list ([`ReviewSession::ensure_side_reads`],
//! after a listing, a fold, a history read; at the path its round's history says the file has
//! now), and kept while the target resolves to the same sides and no refresh touches its path
//! (a watch batch naming it, a git change, a rescan). It is read whole, without the size caps,
//! as the CLI reads it, so a large file places its threads alike; the file view applies the caps
//! to what it shows ("Load anyway"). Read again, it keeps placing threads and showing in the
//! file view until the new read lands, so nothing flickers; a read that fails says why to the
//! file view and leaves its threads unplaced by it (outdated without a file, as before).
//!
//! **The working tree.** The file view also shows a file as the working tree holds it now
//! ([`ReviewSession::worktree_file`]), whatever the review's sides are: where go to definition
//! and references go in a review whose new side isn't the working tree, since a language server
//! reads the working tree (PLAN §18.2). Read the same way, kept apart from the sides' reads.
//!
//! **The disk's reads** (the working tree as it stands, a file outside the repository) are
//! never covered by the watch of a review whose new side isn't the working tree, so the file
//! view's is read again each time it opens and when the window comes back to the front
//! ([`ReviewSession::read_disk_view_again`]), a file outside the repository only once a look
//! (no bytes) finds its length changed; one the file view leaves is dropped, and a read
//! at a side loses its highlights once the file view leaves it (placement keeps its text). A
//! file over the size caps (`DiffLimits`), which the file view shows only after "Load anyway",
//! isn't highlighted.
//!
//! **Outside the repository.** Go to definition into a file outside the repository (a
//! library's declarations) shows it read-only ([`ReviewSession::outside_file`]): read through
//! `Backend::probe_path` (up to `PROBE_READ_MAX`; links on the way followed, as a language
//! server reports a file by its real path anyway), every line a context line, highlighted. A
//! larger file shows the too-large notice; one that isn't there, a read that failed.
//!
//! **Paths.** The side's paths are read once per review open and round, when `Ctrl P` first
//! asks ([`ReviewSession::ensure_side_paths`]), and kept; the finder adds the review's own
//! files to them, so a file the agent created since shows too.
