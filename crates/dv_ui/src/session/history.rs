//! Round histories in the session (PLAN §8 "Round history"): what a closed round's snapshot
//! says about the threads anchored in it that the current text alone can't place — a new-side
//! thread whose file isn't listed, or that relocation calls outdated
//! (`dv_core::review::read_round_history`, read in the background over the session's
//! `GitRepo`, so through the WSL backend too).
//!
//! **Which rounds.** Only rounds some thread needs, for the paths of those threads: a thread
//! whose round's history isn't read for its path is `Pending` (`dv_core::review::place_thread`),
//! never outdated first and then moved, and the session asks for it when, placed without any
//! history, it would be outdated ([`ReviewSession::ensure_histories`], after a listing, a
//! file's load, a full read of a file and a fold). A thread placed before keeps that
//! placement while only its history is missing (`placement`), so a card on screen, and a reply
//! being typed in it, stay until the history lands. A read covers the paths live threads of
//! its round still ask for; one asked for while another runs follows it, with the paths
//! asked for meanwhile, so reads never pile up.
//!
//! **Keeping.** A history is kept while the target resolves to the same sides, the review's
//! files (paths and statuses) are the same and no refresh touches a path it read (its files,
//! what they are called now, the candidates a deleted file was compared with); a rescan or a
//! git change reads it again. While it is read again the one it had keeps placing its threads,
//! so nothing they show flickers; a read again that fails after the basis changed drops it, so
//! nothing is placed against a history that no longer holds. A snapshot never changes, so
//! a read again takes the snapshot's texts from the history it replaces and reads only the
//! interdiff's list and the pairing candidates.
