//! One open review (PLAN §11 `ReviewSession`): its repository and store, the folded review,
//! the target resolved to a [`DiffSpec`], the file list, and each file's diff as it loads.
//!
//! **Loading.** The file list comes first (one background job resolves the target and runs
//! `dv_core::diff::file_list`), then file diffs on demand: the stream asks for the files around
//! its viewport ([`ReviewSession::ensure_loaded`]), at most [`MAX_LOADS_IN_FLIGHT`] load at
//! once, and "Load anyway" reloads one file without the size caps
//! ([`ReviewSession::load_anyway`]). A loaded text diff is then highlighted in the background
//! (`crate::syntax`, token kinds only); rows paint unhighlighted until it lands. Nothing here
//! blocks the UI thread: git, file reads and the store all run in `background_spawn` jobs.
//!
//! **Staleness.** The session's load generation is the stale-completion guard (PLAN §11): a
//! file-list result is applied only if no newer refresh started, and each file load carries a
//! token that a refresh or a "Load anyway" replaces, so a load that finishes after its file was
//! invalidated is dropped. The target never changes, so nothing else can go stale. A file that
//! loads again keeps showing the diff it had until the new one lands
//! ([`ReviewSession::shown`]), so the rows under the reader — a thread's card, the composer
//! being typed in — stay where they are.
//!
//! **Live updates.** A live target (`working`, `staged`, a branch) watches the repository
//! (PLAN §5.3, `watch`): worktree paths and git-state changes are coalesced for
//! [`REFRESH_DEBOUNCE`] and refresh the spec and the file list, keeping every loaded diff whose
//! entry didn't change (same oids, totals and modes, path not in the batch) and reloading the
//! rest; an append to this review's log reloads the fold. The watch starts with the session; a
//! change made before it was registered is never reported, so whatever was read before then is
//! read again once it is. A watch that can't cover the worktree leaves a notice
//! ([`ReviewSession::watch_notice`]) and the session refreshes when the window is activated
//! instead ([`ReviewSession::window_activated`]).
//!
//! **Writes** go through `dv_core::review::ops` on a background thread, never as hand-built
//! events, and the fold reloads afterwards (`writes`); the watch reports the same append, and
//! both paths converge on the log. A reply, Resolve or Reopen on a thread that moved, or whose
//! file was renamed, records its relocated anchor (PLAN §8, `placement`). A viewed toggle that fails says why
//! ([`ReviewSession::viewed_error`]), since its checkbox alone can't.
//!
//! **A remote repository** (a WSL distro's, PLAN §5.2, `connection`): the session follows its
//! backend's connection. A call that fails because the connection was lost raises nothing (the
//! status bar says "reconnecting…"); the reconnect's synthetic rescan reads everything again.
//!
//! **Comparison** (PLAN §2.3, `comparison`): what the files and diffs are, the interdiff since
//! a closed round or all changes. Switching ([`ReviewSession::set_comparison`]) lists again
//! from scratch under a new generation, the diffs shown meanwhile staying on screen until
//! theirs land, so the stream keeps its place; a round snapshot that went missing falls back to
//! all changes and says so ([`ReviewSession::comparison_error`]). An interdiff's listing also
//! lists the target's own files ([`ReviewSession::target_files`]): a thread belongs to the
//! review's file whatever is shown, and a comment anchors on it. Threads are placed through
//! `dv_core::review::place_thread` with the interdiff's own rule (`placement`); placement runs
//! on the UI thread, kept until what it read changes. Every file a thread shows in loads
//! whatever the stream's viewport, and the review's own uncapped diff of a file is read in the
//! background for the threads the stream can't place against what it shows (a file too large to
//! show; in an interdiff, a file it doesn't list, or an old-side thread) (`load`).
