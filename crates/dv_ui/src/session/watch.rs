//! The session's watch (PLAN §5.3): which parts of the repository it watches, and how a batch
//! becomes a refresh or a fold reload.
//!
//! A live target watches its git state (a `working` target's old side moves when the agent
//! commits, a `staged` one lives in the index, a branch's tip moves) and, when its new side is
//! the working tree, the worktree; every target watches the review store, where agents append.
//! The watch starts with the session, off the UI thread (registering it walks the worktree), and
//! restarts when what it should cover changes (a branch checked out or left).
//!
//! **Nothing is lost between a read and the watch.** A change made before the OS watch is
//! registered is never reported, and a list or a diff read before then may already be stale. So
//! the session notes every read made while no registered watch covers it, and once one is
//! registered it reads again what those were: the list (and every diff, when diffs were read),
//! and the fold, which was read when the review opened.
//!
//! **Stopping never blocks a frame.** Dropping a [`WatchHandle`] joins its thread, which may be
//! inside git loading the ignore rules, so the session drops handles on a thread of their own
//! ([`stop_in_background`]): when the watch restarts, and with the session itself.
//!
//! **A watch that ends by itself** (its sink dropped while the session still holds its handle:
//! a remote watch the new server couldn't take back as it was after a reconnect, PLAN §5.2)
//! starts again through [`ReviewSession::ensure_watch`], whose new handle says what it covers
//! now (`worktree_error`), and what was read meanwhile is read again; while the connection is
//! down it starts again once it is back.
