//! The file view (PLAN §18.1 "The file view", DESIGN §4.1 "File view"): one file of the
//! repository whole, at the review's new side (its old side for a file the review deletes),
//! over the main area in place of the stream, one at a time.
//!
//! **The pane.** The file view is the stream's pane in a one-file scope: a second [`DiffPane`]
//! whose one block is that file, so the cursor, line selection, comments and their cards, text
//! selection, the caret, `Ctrl C` and `Ctrl F` (searching that file only) all work as they do
//! in the stream. Its rows are the stream's unified rows with one line number (the side's), no
//! gaps and no footer, under a header of its own (`render`): the path, the side's label, whether
//! the review changes the file, and a close button.
//!
//! **The text.** A file the stream lists (in the comparison shown) is shown from the diff the
//! stream shows, cut to its side ([`side_only`]): its added lines keep their kind, so they wear
//! the diff's tint and marker. Any other file is read at the review's new side
//! (`ReviewSession::side_file`, `dv_core::diff::side_file`), every line unchanged. Both are the
//! side's text as the diff pipeline decodes it, so a line here is the same line, byte for byte,
//! as in the stream, and anchors taken here compare equal (PLAN §8). The session loads and
//! highlights the file whatever the stream's viewport (`ReviewSession::set_file_view`); until
//! the text is there the view shows skeleton rows. A file the side doesn't hold, binary or too
//! large shows a notice instead of lines.
//!
//! **The working tree.** Go to definition and references in a review whose new side isn't the
//! working tree show their place as the working tree holds it now, as the language server read
//! it (PLAN §18.2): the file view then reads the file there ([`DiffPane::open_file_at`],
//! `ReviewSession::worktree_file`), labelled "working tree", read-only (no comments, no
//! threads: its lines aren't the review's).
//!
//! **Outside the repository.** A place outside the repository (a library's declarations under
//! the toolchain) shows the same way, read-only, the file by its absolute path
//! (`ReviewSession::outside_file`), labelled "Outside the repository · read-only" with its
//! path; hover and go to definition work in it where a server answers for it.
//!
//! **Threads.** Every live thread on the file's side that stands at lines of it shows inline
//! under its last line (placed by the same placement the stream uses: in a listed file, or in
//! a file the review doesn't change, `Placement::Unlisted`); comments on the whole file and
//! outdated threads head it. Any line takes a comment (its `+`, `C`, `Shift ↑`/`↓`), anchored
//! on the text shown (`ReviewSession::anchor_in_text`), whether or not the review changes it.
//!
//! **Opening and closing.** The shell opens it ([`DiffPane::open_file`]) from the header menu's
//! View file, `F`, `Ctrl P` and the history; `Esc` once nothing else in it takes the key, or the
//! close button, asks the shell to show the stream again ([`DiffPaneEvent::CloseFileView`]),
//! which kept its place meanwhile.
//!
//! Automation targets: `file_view` (the pane), `file_view/header`, `file_view/close`,
//! `file_view/line/<n>` (a line number), `file_view/comment/<n>` (its `+`) and
//! `file_view/code/<n>/<column>` (a character of a line's code), besides the find bar's and the
//! cards' own.
