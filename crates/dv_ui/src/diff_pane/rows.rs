//! The stream's rows (PLAN §6 steps 5 and 7, DESIGN §4.1): what one file contributes to the one
//! list over every file, as plain data the view renders and the keys move over.
//!
//! A file is its header, then — unless it is collapsed (a viewed file, DESIGN §4.1) — either a
//! notice (loading, failed, binary, too large, a submodule, unmerged, no content change) or its
//! lines: code rows for the shown runs, a gap row for each hidden run (which also heads the run
//! after it with its `@@ -a,b +c,d @@`), and the next-file footer. Unified view shows one line per
//! row; split view pairs the i-th removed line of a change with the i-th added one
//! (`dv_core::diff::split_rows`). Rows are built for the view mode in use only, from lines
//! already loaded, so expanding a gap or switching modes never goes back to git.
//!
//! Thread cards and the composer go between rows ([`Insert`]): after the row that shows their
//! line on their side, or after the gap that hides it. A thread whose anchored text no longer
//! stands at its lines (outdated, PLAN §8) has no line to follow: its card heads the file's rows,
//! right under the header ([`Row::Outdated`]).
