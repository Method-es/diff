//! Comments on a whole file in the stream (PLAN §8, DESIGN §4.1, §5): the cards heading a file
//! and how such a comment is started.
//!
//! A file's rows are headed, right under its header and above its first row or its notice (its
//! skeleton rows too: a comment on the whole file reads none of its text, so its card shows
//! before the file's diff lands), by its comments on the whole file in the order they were
//! added, then the composer writing a new one, then its outdated threads (which show the lines
//! they were written on, so they stand nearest the code). One comes from the header's `⋯` menu
//! ("Comment on file") or `Shift C` on the current file: the composer opens there, on the
//! file's new side, or its old side for a deleted file; an interdiff's old column is a round's
//! snapshot, so there a deleted file takes none, as `C` takes no comment on that column.
