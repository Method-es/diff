//! The diff stream (PLAN §6.7, DESIGN §4.1 "Diff"): one virtualised list over every file of the
//! open review, each file its header and then its rows ([`rows`]: code rows, gap rows, notices
//! and the next-file footer).
//!
//! **Rows and the list.** Each file is a block of rows in the session's file order; the gpui
//! `list` holds one item per row, plus a spacer at the end that lets the last file's header
//! reach the top. A block is rebuilt when its diff lands, a gap expands, it collapses or the view
//! mode changes, and only its rows are spliced, so the rest of the list keeps its measurements.
//! The list scrolls by item, so a file loading above the viewport moves nothing in it; a block
//! rebuilt under the reading position keeps it on the same line ([`RowKey`]), and a file that
//! loads again with other lines carries the reader's lines onto the new ones (`reload`). Rows
//! are built for the view mode in use only, from lines already loaded.
//!
//! **Heights.** Code rows, gaps, headers and notices have fixed heights ([`heights`]); cards,
//! the composer and an opened banner are measured, and their heights are kept as gpui last
//! reported them, since it reports none above the viewport. The spacer counts a row not
//! measured yet at the least any can be, so it is never too short for the last header.
//!
//! **Loading.** The stream asks the session for the files in and around its viewport
//! ([`ReviewSession::ensure_loaded`]); a file shows skeleton rows until its diff lands (and a
//! quiet "Loading…" in its header once that takes longer than [`SKELETON_FOR`]).
//!
//! **Cursor and current file.** A cursor line (and in split view a side) moves with the keys
//! (`nav`); `Shift ↑`/`Shift ↓` extend a selection from it within one file and one side. The
//! **current file** is the cursor's file while the cursor is on screen, else the file at the top
//! of the viewport, whose header stays pinned there. The panel's file list highlights it
//! ([`DiffPaneEvent::CurrentFileChanged`]) and shows a file through [`DiffPane::reveal_file`].
//!
//! **Viewed files** collapse to their header (DESIGN §4.1); the header's chevron opens one
//! again. Long lines clip with a fade and scroll sideways together, one offset for the whole
//! stream (`Shift`+wheel, a trackpad).
//!
//! **Threads** (`threads`, cards from [`crate::thread`]): a thread's card follows the last line
//! of its range on its side, an outdated one heads its file, one whose file left the diff heads
//! the stream in its "Not in the diff" section (`section`, before the first file), a comment on
//! the whole file heads its file ahead of the outdated ones (`file_comment`), and the
//! composer sits under the selected lines (or in the card it answers, or heading the file for a
//! comment on it). `C` comments, `Shift C` comments on the current file, `]`/`[` focus the next
//! and previous unresolved thread, `R` replies to the focused one and `X` resolves or reopens
//! it; every change goes through the session's `review::ops` writes.
//!
//! **Text** (`select`, PLAN §18.1): the mouse selects text in code, a click puts the caret, and
//! `Ctrl C` copies. **Find** (`find`, `search`): `Ctrl F` opens the find bar over the stream,
//! which searches every file of the review, both sides, the text inside gaps included.
//!
//! **The file view** (`file_view`, PLAN §18.1) is a second pane in a one-file scope: one file
//! whole, at the review's new side, drawn as the stream's unified rows with one line number,
//! with everything above working on it as on the stream.
//!
//! The keyboard goes to the main area, which the shell renders with the shown pane's focus
//! handle and key context ([`crate::keymap::DIFF_PANE`], [`DiffPane::bind_actions`]).
//!
//! Automation targets: `stream`, `stream/file/<path>/header` (and its `/chevron`, `/viewed`,
//! `/split`, `/unified`, `/prev`, `/next`, `/menu`), `stream/pinned` (the same parts),
//! `stream/not_in_diff/header` (and its `/chevron`; pinned, `stream/pinned` and its `/chevron`),
//! `stream/menu/<view_file|comment|copy_path|reveal>`, `stream/gap/<path>/<n>` (`/expand`, `/expand_all`),
//! `stream/line/<path>/<old|new>/<n>` (a line number), `stream/notice/<path>` (`/load_anyway`,
//! and a failure's banner parts), `stream/footer/<path>` (`/next`),
//! `code/<path>/<old|new>/<n>/<column>` (a character of a line's code, `render::code`), the
//! find bar's (`find`, `find/input`, `find/prev`, `find/next`, `find/close`), and the cards'
//! and the composer's own (`thread/<id>`, `composer`; [`crate::thread`]).
