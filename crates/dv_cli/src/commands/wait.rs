//! `dv review wait [<id>] [--timeout <s>]` (docs/PLAN.md §10.1): blocks until the reviewer
//! finishes a round, so an agent never polls.
//!
//! It waits on the review's *state*, not on a change: it returns at once when the status is
//! one the agent acts on — `changes_requested` (its turn), `approved` or `closed` (finished;
//! `submitted` for a PR review) — and otherwise blocks until it becomes one. No wakeup is lost:
//! the review was loaded before the store watch is registered, so it is loaded again after,
//! and every batch of the watch that touches the review's log (or may have lost events) loads
//! it once more. A re-check every [`RECHECK`] covers a watch that misses something — due
//! whatever other batches arrive meanwhile ([`until_reload`]) — and a repository the OS can't
//! watch is polled every [`POLL`] instead. A review deleted meanwhile
//! is exit 1; `--timeout` running out is exit 3.
