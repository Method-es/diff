//! Where threads stand in a review's current diff (docs/PLAN.md §8), as the GUI shows them:
//! the review's target resolved now (all changes, never an interdiff) in its home worktree
//! (`Repo::for_review`, PLAN §2.2), its file list, and the full text of each side a
//! thread is anchored on (`file_diff` without caps), handed to
//! `dv_core::review::place_thread`, the one function the GUI places threads with too. A thread
//! found there carries the excerpt of that same diff around its lines (`dv_core::review::excerpt`,
//! PLAN §10.3).
//!
//! A new-side thread of a closed round that the current text alone can't place (its file not
//! listed, or relocation calls it outdated) is read against its round's snapshot
//! (`dv_core::review::read_round_history`, [`Sides::read_history_for`]): only those rounds, for
//! those threads' paths, so its file is followed through a rename since and an outdated one
//! says where its code went, with the excerpt around the lines that replaced it.
//!
//! A write on a thread (`reply`, `address`, `resolve`, `reopen`) records where relocation found
//! it ([`Sides::relocated`], PLAN §8), and `comment add` anchors on a side's text read the same
//! way ([`Sides::side_text`]).
//!
//! A comment on a whole file (a file-level anchor) is placed by its file alone: no diff is read
//! for it, and its round's history only to follow its file.
//!
//! A thread whose file isn't among the review's changes (it never changed, or stopped changing)
//! is placed against that file's text at the review's new side (`dv_core::diff::side_file`,
//! `dv_core::review::place_unlisted`), as the GUI places it: found there, it is placed, with
//! the excerpt of that text around it, and not in the diff (`in_diff: false`).
